# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### ✨ New Features

* **A Menu Bar for Cove (macOS):** Cove now has an official menu bar companion, created by [Robby McCullough](https://github.com/RobbyMcCullough/cove-menubar) and folded into the project with his blessing. The icon shows the stack's health at a glance — full color when Caddy, MariaDB, and Mailpit are all running, light grayscale when only some are, dark grayscale when everything's stopped — and the menu can start or stop Cove, refresh status, and jump straight to the Dashboard, Adminer, Mailpit, or the logs folder, with an optional launch-at-login toggle. It's a dependency-free native app that stays true to Cove's single-file philosophy: the Objective-C source ships embedded inside `cove.sh` itself, and `cove menubar enable` compiles it locally in seconds (using the Command Line Tools every Homebrew machine already has), installs it to `~/Applications`, and launches it — no separate download, no notarization dance. Strictly opt-in: `cove upgrade` never installs it on its own, but once enabled it keeps the app current automatically, and `cove menubar disable` removes it cleanly. If you were running Robby's original standalone build, enabling the official one simply takes its place.

* **Installer No Longer Dies in Non-Interactive Environments:** `install-cove.sh` tested whether `/dev/tty` was readable before wiring it to `cove install`'s interactive prompts — but in containers, CI runners, and `ssh host 'curl | bash'` sessions, `/dev/tty` exists and passes the readability test while actually *opening* it fails with "No such device or address", killing the install before Cove ever ran. The installer now tests that `/dev/tty` can genuinely be opened, so environments without a controlling terminal fall through cleanly to Cove's non-interactive install path. Found by running the installer across six Linux distros in fresh system containers.
* **Binary Fallback Now Works on Minimal RHEL-Family Systems:** Installing a dependency from a release tarball (gum on Fedora/RHEL, where no native package exists) piped it into `tar` — which minimal Rocky/RHEL images don't ship. Worse, the extraction's stderr was suppressed, so the only symptom was a generic "Failed to install gum" with no cause. Cove now installs `tar` via the package manager before its first tarball extraction and lets extraction errors reach the terminal, taking a Rocky Linux 9 container from hard failure to a clean end-to-end install.

## [1.13] - 2026-08-07

Cove learns versions. Pin any site to an older PHP with `cove php` — a native Homebrew php-fpm running behind FrankenPHP, switchable from the dashboard with one click — choose the WordPress release at creation with `cove add mysite 6.4.3`, and audit or update every site's core at once with the new `cove core`. `cove clone` stamps out copies of a seeded site — files, database, URLs — in seconds via copy-on-write. The dashboard dropped its last external dependency so it loads without internet, clicking a row now opens its action menu, and the bundled Adminer jumped to 6.0.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Changes

* **Adminer 6.0:** New installs now ship Adminer 6.0.0 instead of 5.4.2 — the database manager's first major release in Cove's lifetime, bringing shorter URLs, CSV export of a result without re-running the query, column reordering on touch screens, and a batch of upstream XSS/CSRF hardening. Cove's autologin entry point and version-detection logic carry over unchanged, and existing installs pick the new version up through `cove upgrade`'s normal Adminer check. The one casualty was dark-mode syntax highlighting: 6.0 wraps SQL keywords in documentation links colored navy by Adminer's own stylesheet, which made `SELECT` nearly invisible on a dark background — the Cove theme now has those links inherit the surrounding token color, so SQL statements read correctly in both themes.
* **The Dashboard No Longer Needs the Internet:** The site dashboard used to load Alpine.js from unpkg.com on every visit, which meant a machine without a connection — or with unpkg unreachable — got a dead page instead of a site list. The framework is gone entirely: the dashboard is now plain vanilla JavaScript baked into Cove itself, with explicit rendering and delegated event handling replacing Alpine's reactivity. Every behavior carries over — filtering, sorting, pinning, keyboard navigation, the ⌘K palette, right-click menus, undo-window deletes, the add-site flow — and the context menu now measures its real size before positioning, so its bottom items can't land off-screen when opened near the edge of the window.
* **Pick a Site's PHP Version from the Dashboard:** `cove php` gained a UI. Every row's action menu now shows the site's effective PHP version and opens a picker listing Cove's default (FrankenPHP) alongside every Homebrew PHP the machine could run — installed versions switch with one click, versions that aren't installed yet are greyed out but still clickable: choosing one kicks off the `brew install` in the background and pins the site the moment it lands. Picking a version closes the modal instantly and the progress lives on the row itself — the site's PHP chip pulses with the target version while the change applies (seconds for an installed version, minutes when Homebrew is downloading one), then settles when the site is live on it. Sites pinned off the default wear a small `php 8.2`-style chip in the list so a mixed fleet reads at a glance, and a pin that lands mid-server-reload is retried idempotently the same way renames are. Versions that left Homebrew core (8.0, 7.4) appear only when a tap already provides them, so the installer never offers something it can't deliver.
* **Click a Row for Actions, Click ↗ to Open:** Clicking a site row used to launch the site in a new tab, which made the row's real actions (rename, log in, view log, delete) a right-click discovery problem. The interaction is now the other way around: clicking anywhere on a row opens its action menu at the cursor — same menu as right-click — and opening the site lives on a small always-visible ↗ icon beside the domain. The icon is a real link, so cmd-click and middle-click open background tabs like anywhere else on the web. The type pill still filters and the login button still logs in, the ⋯ button is gone since the whole row now does its job, and on phones every action is one tap instead of hidden behind hover.
* **Sort the Dashboard by Type:** The type column header joined name / modified / size as a clickable sort. It groups WordPress sites apart from plain ones and orders the WordPress group by core version — compared segment-by-segment as numbers, so 6.10 lands above 6.9 instead of between 6.1 and 6.2 — which makes "which sites are on an old WordPress" a one-click question. Sites of the same type and version fall back to name order, and the choice persists across visits like the other columns.

### ✨ New Features

* **`cove php` — Per-Site PHP Version Switching:** `cove php mysite 8.2` pins a site to an older PHP; `cove php mysite default` puts it back on the bundled one. FrankenPHP stays the front door for every site — TLS, logs, mappings, and custom directives are untouched — but a pinned site's requests are handed to a native Homebrew `php@8.2` php-fpm over a unix socket via `php_fastcgi`, which keeps the same WordPress rewrite semantics as `php_server`. Cove owns the whole FPM lifecycle: it generates the pool config (Mailpit `sendmail_path`, the Whoops error page, the shared error log, and your `cove memory` limits all carry over), runs each version as a `KeepAlive` launchd unit, starts a version's service when the first site pins it, and stops and removes it when the last one unpins — deleting or cloning sites reconciles automatically on the next reload. As a bonus, native php-fpm is a non-thread-safe build with its own per-pool OPcache, so pinned sites are immune to the ZTS OPcache and Imagick crash classes entirely. Also: `cove add mysite 6.4.3 --php=8.1` creates a site pinned from the very first request, wp-cli commands for a pinned site (`cove login`, `cove core update`, database backups) run under the same PHP the site serves with, `cove php` alone prints every site's effective version plus the state of each FPM service, `cove list` gained a `PHP` column, and `cove status` shows a row per active FPM version. Requires Homebrew on macOS; missing `php@` formulas are offered for install on first pin, and a pin whose binary disappears degrades gracefully back to FrankenPHP rather than 502ing the site.

* **`cove clone` — Copy a Site, Database and All:** `cove clone woo-template poc-acme` duplicates an existing site under a new name: files, database, custom Caddy directives, and a `search-replace` so every stored URL points at the new hostname. The point is fixtures. Building the same scenario by hand — WooCommerce plus a few users, roles, products, and orders — costs far more than the five seconds a fresh install takes, so seed it once and stamp copies instead. On APFS and btrfs the file copy is a copy-on-write clone, which is roughly three times faster than a byte copy and means the two sites share disk until one of them is written to. A clone that fails partway cleans up after itself rather than leaving a half-built site and an orphaned database behind.
* **`cove core` — See and Update the WordPress Version of Every Site:** `cove core check` reports what each site is running and cross-references wp.org's stable-check data to flag anything outdated or insecure. `cove core update <site>` moves one site to the latest release, `cove core update <site> 6.4.3` pins it to a specific version (a downgrade is a legitimate thing to want when reproducing a bug), and `cove core update --all` catches up every site that's behind, with `--dry-run` to preview and `--yes` for scripts. It's deliberately a separate verb from `cove upgrade`, which still upgrades Cove itself.
* **WordPress Versions in the Site List:** `cove list` gained a `WP` column and the dashboard shows each site's version beside its type pill, with a small amber dot on releases wp.org marks insecure. Versions are parsed out of `wp-includes/version.php` rather than booting WordPress, so reading all 250 sites costs milliseconds and still works on a site too broken to serve a request.
* **Choose the WordPress Version When Creating a Site:** `cove add` now takes an optional second argument saying what goes inside the site — `cove add mysite 6.4.3` pins a release, `cove add mysite 6.9-RC1` installs a prerelease, and `cove add mysite nightly` tracks trunk. Reproducing a bug report against the version it was filed on, or checking a plugin against the next release before it ships, no longer means installing the latest and downgrading by hand. The same slot also accepts `plain`, so `cove add mysite plain` is now the natural way to spell what `--plain` has always done, and `latest` is the default you get by passing nothing. `--plain` and `--wp-version=` remain accepted, so nothing that already worked stops working. On the dashboard, the add-site form gained a version dropdown listing the releases wp.org actually shipped (fetched once and cached for a day, flagging the ones marked insecure) rather than a text box you can typo into a failed install two minutes later — and it falls back to `latest` and `nightly` when the machine is offline.

## [1.12] - 2026-07-26

The dashboard grows up: a `⌘K` command palette, right-click and `⋯` row menus, keyboard navigation, and pinned sites, so an install with hundreds of sites stays navigable. `cove pull` and `cove push` now run on Cove's own backup/restore engine over SSH instead of fetching an external script — which also means they work against hosts missing `zip`, `unzip`, `wget`, or a MySQL client. Every interactive prompt gained a flag equivalent so scripts and AI agents never stall on a question they can't answer, a new `cove health` diagnoses crashes and OPcache pressure, and a run of stability fixes clears the OPcache and Imagick segfaults that had been restarting FrankenPHP under load.

### ✨ New Features

* **`cove health` — Read-Only Diagnostic:** A new command that aggregates the signals you'd otherwise gather by hand after a crash. It reports service liveness; the FrankenPHP process state and its last exit code (decoding `-11` SIGSEGV, `-6` SIGABRT/Go-fatal, and `-9` SIGKILL as the watchdog's own deliberate restart rather than an unexplained crash); recent hard crashes from the macOS DiagnosticReports, classified as OPcache-shared-memory vs Imagick vs other; live OPcache pressure (interned-buffer fill %, hit rate, cached/max files, OOM and max-files restart counts) with a concrete `~/Cove/php.ini` remedy when it detects saturation; and on-disk hygiene (zombie site directories, oversized logs). It changes nothing — every finding comes with a recommended fix you choose to run. The OPcache probe queries the running server (not a fresh CLI) and retries so a check landing mid-reload doesn't false-alarm.
* **Sortable Column Headers on the Dashboard:** The site list now has a proper header row (name / type / modified / size). Click a header to sort by that column, click again to flip direction; the choice persists across visits. Replaces the old "sort:" pill that cycled blindly through modes — and finally labels the modified and size columns.
* **Undo-Style Deletes Instead of a Confirm Dialog:** Deleting a site from the dashboard no longer throws a blocking browser `confirm()`. The row disappears immediately and a snackbar offers *undo* for five seconds; only after the window passes does the backend delete run. Deleting more sites during the window merges them into one batch ("Deleted 3 sites — undo"). Closing the tab mid-window flushes the staged deletes with keepalive requests so nothing is silently lost.
* **Bulk Delete for Filtered Sites:** When a filter narrows the list, a "delete N shown" button appears in the filter row. First click arms it ("sure? delete N"), second click stages every matching site through the same undo window and serialized delete queue. Ideal for clearing out batches of throwaway `poc-*` / test sites in one pass.
* **Cove-Themed Empty States:** The "no sites yet" and "no filter matches" states now carry small SVG illustrations (a sailboat in the cove, a periscope scanning the waves) that follow the light/dark theme.
* **Command Palette (⌘K / Ctrl+K):** With a few hundred sites the list is far taller than a screen and scrolling stops being navigation, so search now sits one keystroke away. Type to fuzzy-match a site (ranked so a prefix hit beats a mid-string one) and press Enter to open it, ⌘Enter to jump straight into wp-admin. The same palette runs global commands — add site, reload server, refresh disk sizes, open the database or Mailpit, database credentials, toggle theme — so the things buried in the header and footer are reachable without hunting for them.
* **Right-Click and ⋯ Row Menus:** Each row now has an actions menu with open, log in, copy path, pin, and delete, opened either by right-clicking the row or by a ⋯ button. Both drive one component, so the two can't drift apart. This also fixes a real gap rather than just adding polish: the previous `login path delete` links only appeared on `:hover`, which meant they did not exist at all on touch — and `cove tailscale` exists precisely so you can reach the dashboard from a phone or iPad, where the dashboard was accidentally read-only.
* **Rename, Reveal, Open Database, and View Log From the Row Menu:** Four actions that previously meant dropping to a terminal. **Rename** wraps `cove rename` (directory, database, and URL together) in a modal, and carries pinned/selected state across to the new name so a pinned site doesn't silently unpin itself. **Reveal in Finder** opens the site directory in the desktop file manager (`open` on macOS, `xdg-open` elsewhere), detached so a file manager left in the foreground can't hold the request open. **Open database** deep-links Adminer straight at that site's own schema instead of the server root. **View log** tails the site's Caddy log — the last 64KB rather than an unbounded read — and folds Caddy's JSON-per-line output down to the fields you actually scan (time, status, method, path, duration), with a toggle back to raw. Actions that don't apply are hidden rather than shown broken: a plain static site offers neither "Log in to admin" nor "Open database".
* **Keyboard Navigation of the Site List:** `↑`/`↓` (or `j`/`k` outside a text field) move a selection, `Enter` opens the selected site, `⌘Enter` logs in, `⌘⌫` deletes, `Esc` clears. Arrows work while the filter is focused, so you can type to narrow and pick without reaching for the mouse. The selected row is scrolled into view and marked distinctly from hover.
* **Pinned Sites:** Pin the handful of sites you're actually working on and they float above whatever sort is active, marked with a dot. The choice persists across visits.
* **Service Status Moved Into the Header:** The caddy / mariadb / mailpit indicators used to sit only in the footer, which on a real install is roughly 14,000px down the page — the most glanceable information was the least reachable thing in the UI. They now live in the top bar.
* **The Site List Defaults to Most-Recently-Modified:** "What was I just working on" is a better landing state than "what starts with A". Alphabetical is still one click away on the column header.
* **Every Interactive Prompt Now Has a Flag:** Commands that used to depend on a TUI can be driven entirely by arguments, so scripts, CI, and AI agents never stall on a prompt they can't answer. `cove pull` gains `--ssh`, `--path`, and `--site` (an existing site is overwritten, an unused name is created); `cove push` gains `--site`, `--ssh`, and `--path`; both take `--yes`. `cove install` gains `--http`/`--https` (skipping the port menus outright) and `--db-root-user`/`--db-root-pass` for the manual-credential fallback. `cove directive add|update` gains `--rules "..."` and `--file <path>` alongside the existing stdin pipe. `cove share` gains `--yes` for the on-demand cloudflared install. Where a value genuinely can't be defaulted, the command exits with a message naming the flag to pass instead of aborting with gum's opaque "could not open a new TTY". Prompts still appear exactly as before when you run these interactively.
* **Backup and Restore Are Now Cove's Own:** `cove pull` and `cove push` no longer pipe `https://captaincore.io/do` into bash on your machine *and* on the remote server. That fetched a 7,300-line script to use roughly 490 lines of it, required both ends to be online to a third host, and tied Cove's behaviour to a script released on its own schedule — a mismatch there is what made `cove pull` wipe a database it then refused to restore into. Cove now ships one self-contained transfer engine, run locally with bash and piped into `bash -s --` over the SSH connection pull/push already hold open, so both ends run identical code and nothing is written to the remote filesystem. `cove transfer probe [site]` reports what the engine will use on a given host.
* **Transfers Work on Hosts Missing zip, unzip, tar, wget, or a MySQL Client:** Every capability now degrades instead of failing. Archiving prefers `zip`, falls back to `tar`, and finally to PHP's own `ZipArchive`/`PharData`; the database is dumped and imported with `mysqldump`/`mysql` when they exist and through WordPress's `$wpdb` when they don't. Missing tools are installed first when the host allows it (apt/dnf/yum/apk/zypper/brew, attempted only as root or with passwordless sudo so nothing stops to ask for a password), and a remote with no WP-CLI at all gets `wp-cli.phar` sideloaded over SSH. Because the target is always a WordPress install, PHP is guaranteed — which makes the PHP tier a genuine universal fallback and means a bare host needs no package installs whatsoever. `wget` is no longer needed anywhere: every byte moves over SSH.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Changes

* **Backups Are Fetched Over SSH and Kept Out of the Web Root:** The old flow asked the remote to build a download URL from its own `home` option, then fetched it over public HTTP — which only worked when the remote's WordPress URL was publicly reachable *and* mapped to the directory holding the backup. Staging sites behind basic auth, hosts on private networks, and sandboxes whose `home` still pointed at a provisioning template all failed with "Download failed". Everything now moves over the existing SSH connection, and the archive is written beside the site directory rather than inside it, so a full database dump is never left sitting in a publicly downloadable location.
* **Bulk Transfers No Longer Share the Multiplexed SSH Connection:** pull and push open one shared SSH session so credentials are entered once, but sending the archive through that same channel throttled a 30MB upload to roughly 16KB/s against a real host and then stalled outright — the same file moved in 15 seconds on its own connection. Archive transfers now use a direct connection while the short control commands keep sharing the multiplexed one, and both ends carry keepalives so a genuinely dead link fails instead of hanging forever.

### 🔒 Security & Bug Fixes

* **Dashboard Ran Its Whole Startup Twice:** Alpine calls a component's `init()` automatically, and the template also carried `x-init="init()"`, so everything in it registered twice — every keyboard listener, every `$watch`, the page-hide handler, and the initial site fetch, which meant the dashboard issued two `list_sites` requests on every load. Idempotent work hid it (focusing an input twice looks the same as once), but anything that toggles cancelled itself out. `init()` is now guarded so it runs once.
* **`cove pull` No Longer Empties the Database It's About to Restore Into:** Overwriting an existing site ran a `DROP DATABASE` / `CREATE DATABASE` before invoking the migration, but restoring requires the destination to still be a working WordPress — it has to read the site's current URL to rewrite links — and an emptied database fails that check. The restore aborted having already destroyed the local database, leaving the site with no tables at all. The pre-emptive drop was redundant to begin with: the restore resets the database itself immediately before importing, so the clean slate was already guaranteed at the right moment. The local site now stays intact and servable right up until the restore actually succeeds.
* **`cove pull` Prompted for a MySQL Password Mid-Run (and Hung Headless):** The pull read its database credentials only *after* the restore step, so the drop above expanded to a bare `-p` and stopped at an "Enter password:" prompt — easy to miss in a script and an outright hang with no TTY. Configuration is now loaded at the top of the command.
* **`cove push` Only Worked From Inside the Site's Own Directory:** The local backup is generated in a subshell that `cd`s into the site, so the archive lands in the site directory while the command is still running from wherever it was invoked. Every later reference — the existence check, the upload, the cleanup — used the bare filename against the caller's working directory, so a push from anywhere else failed with "Failed to generate local backup" despite the backup having been created correctly. Those references are now absolute.

* **Mailpit KeepAlive No Longer Thrash-Loops on an Orphan Process:** If any leftover mailpit held `:1025`/`:8025` (a manual start, a brew-services leftover, or a job that outlived `launchctl unload`), the service-managed instance failed to bind, exited, and `KeepAlive`/`Restart=always` respawned it forever — observed at **51k restarts over ~10 days** and a 28MB log of nothing but `address already in use`. Mailpit now starts through a small wrapper (`~/Cove/mailpit-run.sh`) that kills orphaned mailpit processes before `exec`, caps the log at 50MB, and is installed by both `cove enable` and `cove upgrade` (via `post-upgrade`). The macOS plist adds a 30s `ThrottleInterval` as a backstop; the Linux unit switches to `Restart=on-failure` with `RestartSec=5s`. `cove disable` also reaps leftover mailpit, and `cove health` warns when launchd's restart counter climbs or `mailpit.log` balloons.
* **Right-Sized OPcache Stops the Random FrankenPHP Segfaults on Busy Boxes:** FrankenPHP embeds a thread-safe (ZTS) PHP, so every site on the box shares one OPcache arena. PHP's stock limits — 128MB, an 8MB interned-strings buffer, and 10,000 cached files — are sized for a single small FPM pool, but a real Cove box routinely holds 100+ WordPress sites (hundreds of thousands of PHP files; a single large site can have ~50,000). When the arena or the interned-strings buffer fills, OPcache performs a blocking shared-memory *restart*, and under ZTS a restart racing concurrent compiles corrupts shared memory — segfaulting PHP deep inside `cache_script_in_shared_memory` (observed crashing in `lex_scan`, `zend_persist_*`, and `zend_optimize_script`). FrankenPHP's Go runtime then turns that SIGSEGV into a whole-process abort — the same "non-Go code set up signal handler without SA_ONSTACK flag" fatal, but from OPcache rather than Imagick — which reads as the server randomly crashing while editing a heavy plugin (observed: ~16 hard crashes in one afternoon of plugin development, with the interned-strings buffer pegged at 100% and a 14% hit rate). Cove now sizes OPcache for a multi-site box: `memory_consumption=512`, `interned_strings_buffer=64`, `max_accelerated_files=100000`, and `optimization_level=0` (in a `validate_timestamps=1` dev environment files recompile constantly, so the optimizer buys almost nothing and its SSA/DFA/call-graph passes were themselves a recurring crash site). Each value is overridable via the corresponding key in `~/Cove/php.ini`. Applied on the next `cove reload` for the file-count/optimizer settings; the two arena-sizing directives take effect on the next full FrankenPHP start.
* **Watchdog No Longer Kills FrankenPHP Mid-Reload:** On installs with hundreds of sites, applying a regenerated Caddyfile can hold HTTPS requests longer than the watchdog's 3-probe kill threshold — so a routine `cove reload` (fired by every dashboard add/delete) could get a perfectly healthy server SIGKILLed mid-config-swap, trading a ~45-second pause for a multi-minute cold start while TLS re-provisions for every site. The watchdog now holds fire while `cove reload`'s lock file is fresh, without touching the failure streak; the check is age-capped at 5 minutes so a stale lock can't blind it to a genuinely wedged server. Existing installs pick up the new watchdog via `cove upgrade` (or a one-time `cove post-upgrade`).
* **Dashboard Deletes No Longer Race the Background Reload (Second Delete "Not Deleting" / Sites Resurrecting):** Deleting a site in the dashboard fires a background `cove reload`, and a second delete issued while that reload was still in flight could fail two ways. First, the reload's Caddyfile snapshot still named the just-deleted site, so when the stale config applied, Caddy's log directive re-created the site's `logs/` skeleton — resurrecting the "deleted" site in the dashboard (and re-adding its `/etc/hosts` entry). Second, a delete request landing exactly in the FrankenPHP config-swap window could hang and never execute at all. Now: `cove delete` leaves a tombstone and flags an in-flight reload to re-run against the post-delete Sites listing; `cove reload` prunes tombstoned skeletons; the Caddyfile and `/etc/hosts` generators skip directories that aren't servable sites (no `public/` and no custom directive); the dashboard retries deletes whose response was dropped mid-reload; and the delete API is idempotent, so a retry that finds the site already gone reports success.
* **FrankenPHP No Longer Crashes on WordPress Image Processing (Imagick vs. Go):** FrankenPHP embeds a thread-safe PHP built with the `imagick` extension baked in. The first time any request constructs an `Imagick` object, ImageMagick's `MagickWandGenesis()` installs its own `SIGSEGV`/`SIGBUS`/`SIGABRT` handlers **without** the `SA_ONSTACK` flag — but Go, FrankenPHP's runtime, owns `SIGSEGV` for goroutine stack-growth guard pages. The next stack-growth signal then trips `fatal error: non-Go code set up signal handler without SA_ONSTACK flag` and the whole server aborts (the watchdog restarts it, producing the ~45s rebind windows and `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` bursts). Because WordPress uses Imagick as its default image editor, every thumbnail, resize, and upload was a trigger, so image-heavy sites under load crashed repeatedly. The bundled MU-plugin now forces the GD image editor (`wp_image_editors` → `WP_Image_Editor_GD`), so Imagick is never instantiated and `MagickWandGenesis()` never runs; GD covers every core WordPress image need. A site that genuinely needs Imagick can opt back in with `add_filter( 'cove_force_gd_editor', '__return_false' )`. Existing sites pick up the fix via `cove upgrade` (or a one-time `cove post-upgrade`).
* **`cove upgrade` Now Self-Locates via `$0` Instead of PATH:** The upgrade flow resolved its install path with `command -v cove`, which finds whatever `cove` happens to sit in PATH rather than the copy actually running. When cove runs through a shell alias or an absolute path, those can differ — a stale v1.8 binary left in `/opt/homebrew/bin` answered a v1.11 upgrade's `post-upgrade` call with "Unknown command" (skipping the Whoops/MU-plugin/watchdog refresh) and ran `reload` through three-versions-old dashboard and Caddyfile generators. The running script's own `$0` is now authoritative, with PATH lookup kept only as a fallback.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-07-05

### 🔒 Security & Bug Fixes

* **Whoops No Longer Promotes `E_WARNING` to a Full-Screen Crash Page:** The Whoops bootstrap's silence mask covered notices, deprecations, and `E_USER_WARNING`, but not plain `E_WARNING` — so a harmless warning like PHP's "Cannot modify header information - headers already sent" (core's own `Content-Type` header colliding with a plugin that echoed output early, as LearnDash's setup wizard does) was converted into a fatal `ErrorException` and rendered as a full-screen crash, even with `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` off. `E_WARNING` is now silenced alongside the other non-fatal levels, so the Whoops page is reserved for actual fatals and uncaught exceptions. Existing sites pick up the regenerated bootstrap via `cove upgrade` (or a one-time `cove post-upgrade`). Reported in [#5](https://github.com/anchorhost/cove/issues/5).

## [1.11] - 2026-07-05

### ✨ New Features

* **nanobrew Opt-In Package-Manager Support:** On macOS, Cove can now drive services through [nanobrew](https://github.com/nanobrew/nanobrew) (`nb`) instead of Homebrew — opt in via `COVE_PKG_MANAGER=nanobrew`, or it's picked automatically when only `nb` is installed. A new `pkg_service` helper abstracts `brew services` / `nb services` for every caller (including emulating the missing `nb services restart`), and `cove install` initializes the MariaDB data directory itself on nanobrew since `nb` skips Homebrew's Ruby `post_install` hooks.
* **FrankenPHP Watchdog:** A standalone watchdog script (installed by `cove enable`, run by launchd/systemd) detects "zombie" FrankenPHP — process alive and accepting TCP connects, but HTTPS requests hang, as happens on the rare "panic during panic" crash path — and SIGKILLs it so the service manager respawns a fresh instance. Uses an HTTP-level probe with a startup grace period so it never kills a server that's still provisioning certs for hundreds of sites. Ships alongside FD-limit and signal-handling hardening for large installs.
* **`--yes` on `cove install` / `cove delete`:** Both commands now accept `--yes` for scripted callers, skipping interactive confirmation.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Changes

* **Cheap `cove status` — No More Homebrew on the Polling Path:** On macOS, `cove status` checked MariaDB by shelling out to `brew services list`, which boots a full Homebrew Ruby interpreter (~1–2s idle, far longer under load). With the menu bar app polling status every few seconds, slow calls stacked into a feedback loop that drove load average past 50 and starved FrankenPHP until the watchdog restarted it. MariaDB is now probed with a new `is_mariadb_running` helper — a single `mysqladmin ping` handshake (with a `pgrep mariadbd` fallback) — bringing a full `cove status` run down to well under a second no matter how often it's polled.
* **Shorter One-Time Login URLs:** `cove login` tokens are now 7 characters (`cove_login_token`), making magic-login URLs comfortably paste-able.
* **Wider `gum` Inputs + Shared SSH Auth Across `cove pull` / `cove push`:** Remote-sync prompts render at a usable width, and pull/push share a single SSH authentication flow instead of prompting separately.
* **`cove enable` Reports Success Based on Caddy, Not the Watchdog Install:** The green "Services are running" banner was gated on the watchdog install's exit code (almost always 0), so a Caddyfile that kept FrankenPHP from starting still showed all-green. It now polls `is_caddy_running` and shows the "Caddy failed to start" error when the server never answers.
* **`cove reload` Surfaces a Failed Reload:** `cove_reload` always returned 0 even when `frankenphp reload` rejected the regenerated Caddyfile (bad directive, port conflict), so CLI and upgrade callers couldn't tell the new config never went live. It now returns the reload's status and prints an error pointing at `caddy-reload.log`.
* **`cove disable` Stays Disabled Across a Reboot (Linux):** `cove enable` runs `systemctl enable` on its units, but `cove disable` only stopped them — so after a reboot FrankenPHP came back and re-grabbed ports 80/443, defeating the point of disabling. `cove disable` now also `systemctl disable`s `cove.service` and `cove-watchdog.timer` (MariaDB is left enabled as shared infrastructure).
* **`cove upgrade` No Longer Caps an Unlimited `memory_limit`:** The upgrade memory floor treated `memory_limit = -1` (unlimited) as below 1G and silently rewrote it to 1G, OOM-ing large imports that previously worked. `-1` is now recognized as unlimited and left untouched.
* **`cove status` Reflects Real Mailpit Liveness (macOS):** Status checked whether launchd had the Mailpit job *loaded*, which stays true even while it crash-loops, so a dead Mailpit showed "Running." It now probes the process directly with `pgrep`.
* **`cove delete` Drops the Database Named in `wp-config.php`:** Delete derived the database name as `cove_<site>` rather than reading the site's actual `DB_NAME`, so a site whose DB was renamed left its real database orphaned — and could drop an unrelated database that matched the derived name. It now reads `DB_NAME` from `wp-config.php`, falling back to the derived name only when that can't be read.
* **Watchdog State Reset on (Re)install:** Registering the watchdog now clears its saved `.watchdog.state`, so a disable/enable cycle where the OS reuses FrankenPHP's previous PID can't leave a stale "healthy" record that bypasses the never-kill-while-starting guard and SIGKILLs a server that's still provisioning certs.
* **Tailscale Reverse-Proxy Detection Handles Hyphenated Hosts:** The regex deciding whether a site is a pure reverse-proxy on its tailnet port omitted hyphens/underscores, so `reverse_proxy app-server:3000` fell through and was served as a filesystem root over Tailscale instead of being proxied. The host character class now includes `-` and `_`.

### 🔒 Security & Bug Fixes

* **Whoops Bumped to 2.18.0 — Fixes Site-Wide 500s Under PHP 8.5:** Cove bundled Whoops 2.15.3, which throws a `TypeError` from `Run::register()` under FrankenPHP's PHP 8.5 (web SAPI). Because `whoops_bootstrap.php` is `auto_prepend`ed to every request, that fatal 500-ed *every* site at once — and it surfaced the moment a `cove upgrade` (or Homebrew) moved FrankenPHP onto PHP 8.5. The bundled version is now pinned to 2.18.0 via a shared `deploy_whoops` helper, and — critically — `cove upgrade` now refreshes Whoops (it previously never did, so upgraders were left on the incompatible copy). The bootstrap is also wrapped so any future Whoops/PHP incompatibility degrades to "no pretty error pages" instead of taking every site down.
* **Dashboard API Cross-Origin (CSRF) Guard:** The dashboard's `api.php` mutates state (`add_site` / `delete_site` / reload) and reads the request body via `php://input` regardless of `Content-Type`, so a malicious page the developer visited could drive it with a CORS "simple" `text/plain` POST that skips preflight — deleting local sites without ever reading the response. POST requests are now rejected unless their `Origin` (or, failing that, `Referer`) host matches the dashboard's own host. Same-origin dashboard traffic (including on a custom HTTPS port) is unaffected.
* **`cove upgrade` Refreshes the Login MU-plugin Across All Sites:** The one-time-login MU-plugin (`captaincore-helper.php`) is injected per-site at creation and was never updated afterward, so security fixes to it (like the auth-bypass fix) and its runtime `option_home`/`option_siteurl` filters stayed stale on every existing site. `cove upgrade` now sweeps every WordPress site and re-pushes the plugin wherever the deployed `Version:` header is behind the bundled `MU_PLUGIN_VERSION` (bumped to 0.4.0) — idempotent, so unchanged sites aren't rewritten. `cove login` continues to lazily re-inject for the site you're logging into. As part of this, all of upgrade's component refreshes (Whoops, its bootstrap, the MU-plugin, the watchdog) now run through the freshly-installed on-disk binary via an internal `post-upgrade` step, so they deploy the *new* code rather than whatever the still-running pre-upgrade script held.
* **One-Time Login Tokens Now Expire:** The `cove login` / dashboard magic-login token was stored in user meta and only cleared on a successful login, so an unclicked link stayed a valid standing credential forever. Tokens now carry a mint timestamp and expire 15 minutes after issue, closing the window in which a stale (or brute-forced) token could be replayed against an exposed site.
* **Remote Backup Artifacts Cleaned Up on Failed `cove push` / `cove pull`:** Both commands stage a full backup zip (DB dump + `wp-config.php`) in the remote web root, but only removed it on the success path — a failed restore left it directly downloadable by filename. The failure paths now delete the local and remote backup artifacts before aborting. Also fixes a misplaced `>&2` in push's `log_error` that sent error banners to stdout.
* **Unauthenticated Admin-Login Bypass in the Injected mu-plugin (Fixed):** The `wp_ajax_nopriv_captaincore_quick_login` handler gated on `$post->token != md5(AUTH_KEY)` with a loose `!=`, so a JSON body `{"token":true}` coerced to `true != <hash>` → `false` and slipped past the check, minting a working one-time admin login URL with no credentials. This mu-plugin is injected into every Cove WordPress site, so any site exposed via `cove lan` / `cove share` / Tailscale was reachable. Now uses `hash_equals()` with a string-type guard.
* **`cove upgrade` Now Installs the FrankenPHP Watchdog:** The watchdog was only ever written by `cove enable`, which upgraders never re-run — so a 1.10 install could `cove upgrade` to the new binary yet never get the watchdog, leaving it exposed to the exact zombie-FrankenPHP lockup the watchdog exists to auto-recover from. Watchdog registration is now a shared `install_watchdog_service` helper called by both `cove enable` and `cove upgrade` (via the freshly-installed on-disk binary so the new function runs).
* **Shared `validate_site_name` — Path-Traversal Hardening:** `cove delete`, `cove login`, and the dashboard's `delete_site` never validated the site name's character set (unlike `cove add`), so a name like `../evil` escaped the `Sites/` tree — and `cove delete` would `rm -rf` it, escalating to `sudo -n rm` on failure. A single `validate_site_name` helper (mirroring `cove add`'s rules) now guards every command that turns a name into a filesystem path, and the dashboard applies the same regex it uses for `add_site`.
* **`cove pull` No Longer Drops the Local Database Before the Backup Exists:** When overwriting an existing site, pull ran `DROP DATABASE; CREATE DATABASE` *before* generating the remote backup — so if the backup step then failed, the local database was already gone with no rollback, leaving the site more broken than a no-op. The destructive reset is now deferred until a valid backup URL is in hand.
* **`cove rename` Verifies the DB Import Before Dropping the Old Database:** The import into the new database was unchecked, yet the old database was dropped unconditionally afterward — so a failed import (disk full, packet size, name collision) destroyed the site's only good copy. The `DROP` is now gated on a verified import *and* `wp-config.php` update; on failure the rename aborts with the old database and config left intact. Search-replace failures are downgraded to a warning since the data is already migrated.
* **`cove add` No Longer Deletes a Working Site When Cosmetic Cleanup Fails:** The install subshell's exit status was whatever the trailing `wp plugin delete hello akismet` returned, so if those plugins were already absent (custom WP package, re-run) the non-zero result tripped the "installation failed" path and `rm -rf`'d a fully-installed site plus its database. The rollback is now gated on the actual `core install` step, and the plugin cleanup is tolerated with `|| true`.

## [1.10] - 2026-04-20

### ✨ New Features

* **`cove trust` Command:** A one-shot installer that drops Cove's local root certificate into the OS trust store and every NSS database it can find, so Firefox and Chromium stop showing "Not Secure" warnings on `*.localhost` without hand-rolling `certutil` commands.
    * Wraps `frankenphp trust` for the baseline (macOS login keychain, Linux `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates` + `~/.pki/nssdb` + `~/.mozilla/firefox/*`).
    * On Linux, auto-installs `libnss3-tools` / `nss-tools` if `certutil` is missing, then walks `~/snap/*/common/.mozilla/firefox/*/cert9.db` and `~/snap/chromium/*` to inject the root into snap-packaged browsers — a path Caddy's built-in scanner doesn't touch.
    * Idempotent on re-run: existing "Cove Local Authority" entries are removed before the current root is re-added, so rotating the Caddy CA doesn't stack stale copies.
    * `cove install` calls `cove_trust` at the end of first setup, so a fresh install is trusted everywhere with no extra step.
* **`cove memory` Command:** A cross-cutting view + editor for PHP `memory_limit` everywhere it can bite you.
    * `cove memory` prints a side-by-side report: Cove's own `~/Cove/php.ini`, the `memory_limit` baked into the Caddyfile's `frankenphp` block, every `php` binary on `PATH` (version + loaded ini + live value), and `wp-cli`'s effective PHP.
    * `cove memory set <value>` writes `memory_limit`, `upload_max_filesize`, and `post_max_size` into Cove's ini (values accept `512M`, `2G`, or `-1` for unlimited), regenerates the Caddyfile so FrankenPHP picks up the new limits, then walks external inis on `PATH` and offers to update each one individually.
    * New `cove_ini_get` helper in `main` makes Cove's ini the single source of truth: `regenerate_caddyfile` reads the current values at render time instead of hardcoding `512M`.
    * `cove memory set --yes` accepts every writable ini non-interactively for scripted fleet updates.
* **Cove-Branded Landing Page for Plain Sites:** `cove add --plain` now writes a designed `index.php` that matches the dashboard and landing page palette — Fraunces italic headline, Geist/Geist Mono body, teal accent, and the cove brand mark — instead of leaving an empty directory that serves a 404. The page reads `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` and `__FILE__` at request time, so it self-identifies no matter which hostname or mapping serves it, and includes a `~`-shortened absolute path so users can jump straight to the file they need to edit.
* **Linux `cove.service` Systemd Unit:** `cove enable` now generates `/etc/systemd/system/cove.service` alongside the existing `mailpit.service`, so the whole stack survives a reboot without a manual `cove enable` on each boot.
    * Runs FrankenPHP as the invoking user (not root), `Restart=on-failure` with a 2s backoff, and passes `PHPRC` + `HOME` so `php-cli` sees the same ini Cove writes.
    * `cove enable` stops any ad-hoc FrankenPHP left over from a pre-1.10 install before `systemctl` takes the listening sockets, and `cove disable` now stops `cove.service` first (with a fallback to `frankenphp stop` for users who never re-ran `cove enable`).
    * `cove install` masks the distro-packaged `frankenphp.service` that ships with the apt package — previously that unit would fight Cove for ports 80/443.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Changes

* **Adminer 5.4.2 with a Native Cove Skin:** The old Catppuccin-derived theme has been replaced with a full redesign matching the dashboard and landing page — warm cream + teal palette in light mode, dark olive + teal in dark mode, Fraunces/Geist/Geist Mono typography.
    * Explicit light/dark toggle in the Adminer header, persisted in `localStorage` and applied synchronously via a head-injected inline script so there's no theme flash on load.
    * Drag-to-resize sidebar (persisted, clamped 180–480px) so wide table names don't truncate.
    * Cove's `AdminerCoveLogin` class now overrides `head()` to inject the pre-paint theme script and `adminer.js` via `\Adminer\nonce()`, so the CSP nonce the Adminer core emits lines up with Cove's asset.
    * Stale Catppuccin preview screenshots (`adminer-theme/assets/*.webp`) removed from the repo.
* **Dashboard — Post-Create Alerts, Spinner, and Smart Errors:** After creating a site the dashboard now shows a persistent dismissible alert row with either "Log in to admin" (WP) or "Open site" (plain), so the one-time login URL is one click away instead of buried in the toast that fades in 3.5s.
    * Inline spinner on the create button plus an animated teal progress stripe across the top of the add-row while `cove add` is running (site creation takes 5–10s; the extra cue makes the wait feel intentional).
    * New-site row now carries the correct `size_bytes` from the server's inline `du -sk` measurement, so the size column shows "4.0 KB" immediately instead of `—` until the next refresh.
    * Backend translates known `cove add` failure signatures into user-facing messages ("Site name is taken", "That name is reserved", "Invalid site name", "WordPress installation failed — check the logs") instead of a flat "An error occurred."
    * Dashboard header pills for `db` and `mail` now carry inline SVG icons (barrel database, envelope) that inherit `currentColor` so they tint correctly in both themes.
    * Inline `data-theme` bootstrap runs in `<head>` before any CSS paints, eliminating the first-frame FOUC on cold loads.
* **`cove upgrade` Now Refreshes the Full Cove Surface:** Pre-1.10 `cove upgrade` only replaced `cove.sh` + `frankenphp` + `adminer-core.php`, which left upgraders stuck with the old Catppuccin CSS, the old Adminer `index.php`, and whatever `memory_limit` they'd set in the past.
    * Extracted a shared `deploy_adminer_theme` helper used by both `cove install` and `cove upgrade`. Upgraders now pick up the new Cove skin, the theme toggle, and the resizable sidebar in a single `cove upgrade` — no reinstall required.
    * Floors Cove's `memory_limit`/`upload_max_filesize`/`post_max_size` at `1G` (the fresh-install default) but leaves any user-set value `>= 1G` untouched, so a user who bumped to `2G` stays at `2G`.
    * Runs `cove reload` at the end of the upgrade (via the on-disk binary so the newly-replaced script's functions are in use), so dashboard and Caddyfile changes apply without a second manual step.
* **Scripted Flags on Confirmation-Only Prompts:** Following the `cove ports --yes` fix, the rest of the confirmation-only prompts now accept `--force` / `--yes` and auto-promote when stdin isn't a TTY, so dashboard-backed and CI-driven use never deadlocks on `gum confirm`.
    * `cove directive delete <name> [--force]`
    * `cove proxy add <name> <domain> <target> [--force]` (skips the overwrite confirm)
    * `cove proxy delete <name> [--force]`
    * `cove memory set <value> [--yes]` (accepts every writable ini in one shot)
    * `cove upgrade [--yes]` (skips the prompt shown when the local Adminer version can't be parsed)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **Linux — Pre-1.10 Sites and Reload Lock Were Root-Owned:** Before v1.10, Cove sudo-started FrankenPHP on Linux so it could bind 80/443. Every site created from the dashboard, every `/etc/hosts` edit, the reload lock dir, and the `caddy.pid` file ended up owned by root — which meant a later user-run `cove delete` silently failed (with a success message) and a user-run `cove reload` couldn't reclaim its own lock. v1.10 flips this entirely:
    * `cove install` runs `setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep'` on the FrankenPHP binary so it can bind low ports as the invoking user, without sudo.
    * `cove enable` writes `cove.service` with `User=$current_user`, so the systemd-managed process is user-owned going forward.
    * A new `heal_cove_state_ownership` helper runs at the top of `cove_reload` and repairs ownership of the reload lock, `caddy.pid`, and site directories left behind by a pre-1.10 install.
    * `cove delete` now falls back to `sudo -n rm -rf` when the site dir is root-owned, and surfaces a real error (with the exact recovery command) instead of silently skipping the delete.
* **Concurrent Reloads Deadlocking Caddy's Admin Server:** The dashboard fires `reload_server` in the background after every site add/delete (`shell_exec '…&'`), so bulk actions would spawn many concurrent `cove reload` processes. Two parallel `frankenphp reload` calls reliably deadlock Caddy's admin endpoint with its 10s shutdown timeout, wedging further reloads *and* HTTP requests. v1.10 serializes reloads with an atomic lock: first caller does the work, subsequent callers touch a `pending` marker and exit, and the holder re-runs once if the marker is set — so the final state always converges on the latest Sites listing.
* **Reload Lock TOCTOU Allowing 3+ Concurrent Reloads:** The initial `mkdir + echo > pid` implementation of the reload lock left a window where a competing reload could `cat` an empty `pid` file, decide the holder was dead, and stomp the lock — letting two or more reloads run in parallel and race `create_gui_file`'s `.tmp` writes. Switched to a single lock file opened with `set -C` (noclobber) so the pid is written atomically with the lock's creation. The cleanup trap is also paired with an explicit `rm -f` at function end, since the trap was observed not firing reliably under `shell_exec('cove reload &')`.
* **Dashboard Deletes Queued During Reload Were Lost:** `processDeleteQueue` would `shift()` every item once, `await apiPost('reload_server')`, and then return — but deletes queued *during* that await would sit forever, because the next `deleteSite()` call short-circuited on `isProcessingQueue`. Wrapped the drain in an outer loop so post-reload enqueues are picked up in the same batch.
* **Adminer Session Warnings on Every Request:** The apt `php-zts` package defaults `session.save_path` to `/var/lib/php-zts/session`, owned by the `frankenphp` user. Since Cove now runs FrankenPHP as the *invoking* user, that path is unwritable and Adminer emits a `session_start(): Failed to read session data` warning on every request. The Caddyfile now pins `session.save_path` to `~/Cove/cache/sessions/` (auto-created by `regenerate_caddyfile`), so sessions land somewhere the process can actually write to.

## [1.9] - 2026-04-18

### ✨ New Features

* **Redesigned Dashboard:** The built-in web dashboard at `https://cove.localhost` has been fully rewritten to match the Cove landing page.
    * Warm-dark-first palette with a teal accent (`oklch(72% 0.12 190)` in dark mode), Fraunces/Geist/JetBrains Mono typography, and a new SVG cove/bay brand mark with disc/land/horizon/water/waves/ring layers and theme-aware colour overrides.
    * Single rounded card with a soft elevation shadow, three-tier backgrounds (`--bg` / `--panel` / `--bg-sunk`), and subgrid columns so every WP/STATIC pill, modified stamp, size, and action row lines up across rows instead of sizing independently.
    * Per-site size cache at `~/Cove/cache/site-sizes.json`, populated by a new `refresh_sizes` API action. The dashboard shows cached bytes, auto-refreshes on an empty cache, and exposes a manual ↻ button in the footer.
    * "Last modified" column backed by a `modified_at` field in `list_sites` (mtime of `public/` falling back to the site dir), rendered as relative time with the full timestamp on hover.
    * Filter input with `/` focus shortcut (GitHub-style), Esc to clear, and clickable WP/STATIC pills that set a dedicated `type:` chip for exact-type matching rather than substring.
    * Sort pill cycles name / size / modified.
    * Matched substrings in domain names are wrapped in `<mark>` so the letters you typed are highlighted as you filter. The site-name portion of each domain is accented in teal while the `.localhost` suffix stays dim.
    * Optimistic single-flight delete queue: rows pop out instantly, the backend runs deletes sequentially so concurrent deletes can't race on Caddyfile regeneration or `/etc/hosts` writes, and a single reload fires at the end.
    * Click anywhere on a row to open the site — skipped when text is selected so drag-to-copy still works.
    * Login button uses an inline-grid label/spinner stack so the loading state can't shift neighbouring actions.
    * Snackbar fades in/out (no sliding) and is centered without transform so Alpine's transition styles don't fight CSS centering.
    * Theme defaults to `prefers-color-scheme` on first visit; the moon/sun toggle cross-fades between two stroked SVGs in a 32×32 bordered button.
    * Inline SVG favicon ships with the dashboard — no extra asset to deploy.
* **Installer `--main` Mode:** `install-cove.sh` now accepts `--main` to pull `cove.sh` from the `main` branch instead of the latest GitHub release, giving testers a one-liner for verifying unreleased changes.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Changes

* **`cove.sh` PATH Hardening:** `cove.sh` now prepends `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, and `~/.local/bin` to `PATH` at the top of the script. Callers with a minimal `PATH` — launchd plists, systemd units, and the dashboard's `shell_exec` — can now find `gum`, `wp`, `frankenphp`, and `mariadb` without per-platform shims.
* **Shared Caddy Start Helpers:** New `is_caddy_running` and `start_caddy_service` helpers in `main`. `regenerate_caddyfile` probes `localhost:2019` before reloading and starts Caddy if it's down (the start reads the fresh Caddyfile, so no separate reload is needed). `cove enable` delegates to the shared helper instead of duplicating the macOS/Linux start block.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **`cove add` No Longer Lies About Success on a Stopped Stack:** On a stopped stack, `cove add` used to print "Caddy configuration reload initiated" while the reload silently failed, leaving the new site unreachable until the user noticed and ran `cove enable`. `regenerate_caddyfile` now detects a down Caddy and starts it, and the reload itself is no longer backgrounded — we wait for the admin API to return and surface a real error if it fails. The deadlock that originally motivated backgrounding is now handled at the PHP layer (the dashboard's `reload_server` already backgrounds `cove reload` via `shell_exec '…&'`).
* **First TLS Request After `cove add` Hitting `tlsv1 alert internal error`:** On a busy running stack, the old backgrounded reload plus `sleep 0.25` returned before Caddy had issued the new hostname's internal-CA cert. `cove add` now polls the site's HTTPS URL for up to ~2s after reload so the cert is warmed up before the command returns. Happy-path cost is one ~5ms probe.
* **`cove db backup` Overwriting Previous Snapshots:** Backups were always written to `../private/database-backup.sql`, so a second run silently clobbered the earlier snapshot. Each backup now includes a `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` suffix so repeat runs accumulate instead of overwriting.
* **Orphan `/etc/hosts` Entries After `cove delete`:** `cove reload` appends `127.0.0.1` entries for every site hostname and custom mapping, but `cove delete` previously only removed the site directory and the custom Caddy directive file — the `/etc/hosts` lines lingered forever. Delete now reads the mappings file before `rm -rf`, then uses `sudo sed -i.bak -E` to strip the matching `127.0.0.1` lines in one pass, only prompting for sudo when entries actually need removing.
* **Dashboard Delete Hanging on Sudo Prompt:** The `/etc/hosts` cleanup inside `cove delete` used plain `sudo sed`, which hangs the caller when there's no TTY — notably the dashboard's PHP `shell_exec`, which was locking up the UI waiting for a password prompt nothing could answer. `cove delete` now checks `[ -t 0 ]` and drops to `sudo -n` otherwise, so it fails fast with a warning instead of blocking the whole delete flow.
* **`cove rename` Temp File Collisions and Symlink Risk:** The old database dump was written to a predictable `/tmp/${old_db_name}.sql` path, which collides if two renames run in parallel and is a symlink-attack vector on shared systems. Switched to `mktemp` with a `trap EXIT` cleanup so the temp file is removed on any exit path, not just the happy path.
* **Shell Injection in `cove pull` and `cove push`:** Interpolating `$remote_path` into `ssh "cd $remote_path && …"` passed shell metacharacters — spaces, semicolons, `$(…)` — straight through to the remote shell. A path with a space would break the `cd`; a path with a `;` or `$(…)` would execute arbitrary commands on the remote server. A new `shell_quote` helper wraps values in single quotes and rewrites interior `'` as `'\''`, and `pull`/`push` now route `$remote_path` and `$backup_filename` through it at every `ssh` call site.
* **Installer Prompts Silently Falling Through Under `curl | bash`:** When the installer is run the documented way — `bash <(curl -sL https://cove.run/install-cove.sh)` — bash's stdin is the piped script, so every `gum confirm/choose/input` during `cove install` received a closed stdin and silently fell through. `install-cove.sh` now wires the child `cove install` call to `/dev/tty` when it's readable so the interactive port-conflict and option prompts actually work during the fresh install.

## [1.8] - 2026-04-15

### ✨ New Features

* **Alternative HTTP/HTTPS Ports:** Cove can now run alongside other local WordPress tools (Local, WordPress Studio, DevKinsta, MAMP) that already bind 80/443. The installer detects conflicts and offers a menu of alternatives.
    * IPv4 **and** IPv6 port probing via bash `/dev/tcp`, so the check works even against root-owned listeners (which `lsof` can't see from a regular user on macOS).
    * Recommended fallback ports `8090`/`8453` — picked specifically to avoid the well-trodden 8080/8443/8888/8881 range used by Docker, Lando, wp-env, MAMP, and WordPress Studio.
    * Chosen ports persist to `~/Cove/config` and are emitted into the Caddy global block as `http_port`/`https_port`. Site blocks continue to use their plain `site.localhost {}` form — Caddy handles the rewrite automatically.
    * Re-running `cove install` on a machine with non-default ports saved presents a "Keep current / Switch to default / Pick custom" menu so you can migrate in either direction.
* **`cove ports` Command:** A new top-level command to reconfigure ports at any time, not just during install.
    * Interactive menu by default; accepts `--http PORT --https PORT` for scripted use.
    * After a port change, walks every WordPress site under `~/Cove/Sites/` and runs `wp search-replace --all-tables --skip-plugins --skip-themes` to rewrite stored URLs (siteurl, home, serialized content, custom mappings) so existing sites keep working on the new port.
    * Iterates each hostname a site answers on — base domain *plus* any entries in `site/mappings` — so extra domains don't get left stale.
    * `--dry-run` previews the port change and per-site replacement counts without committing anything.
    * `--skip-urls` changes ports without touching databases, for power users who want to migrate manually.
    * Shows a confirmation list before running (ask-once, not per-site).
    * `cove install` now also runs this DB migration step when a re-install changes ports with pre-existing WordPress sites on disk.
* **FrankenPHP-Backed `wp-cli`:** Cove now uses FrankenPHP's bundled PHP for *both* the web server and `wp-cli` invocations, removing the standalone `brew install php` dependency entirely.
    * `get_wp_cmd` routes all wp-cli calls through `frankenphp php-cli` — one PHP runtime for everything Cove touches.
    * A dedicated `~/Cove/php.ini` is written at install time and exported via `PHPRC`, giving Cove full control of `memory_limit`, `display_errors`, and `error_reporting` without fighting any system-wide `/opt/homebrew/etc/php/*/php.ini`.
    * `cove list`, `cove db`, and `cove upgrade` also use `frankenphp php-cli -r` for their inline PHP helpers, so Cove works on a fresh Apple Silicon Mac with zero standalone PHP installed.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Changes

* **Tailscale Access Serves Sites Directly:** `cove tailscale enable` now serves site files directly from the Tailscale-scoped server block instead of reverse-proxying through the local `site.localhost` block. This fixes CSS/JS/image loading when a site is accessed from a remote device.
* **Dynamic siteurl/home Override:** The bundled `captaincore-helper.php` MU-plugin now filters `option_home` and `option_siteurl` at request time when a site is accessed via a non-`.localhost` host (Tailscale, LAN, or `cove share`). Assets resolve against the *current* host so the page renders correctly, and `wp-cli` is unaffected.
* **Smarter FrankenPHP Upgrade:** `cove upgrade` now detects how FrankenPHP was installed and uses the right upgrade path — `apt` or `dnf` for distro-packaged installs, direct download for static binaries.
* **macOS Services via `launchd`:** Caddy, Mailpit, and the Cove-managed services now run via custom `launchd` plists on macOS instead of `brew services`, giving Cove precise control over process arguments and log routing, plus proper auto-restart on crashes.
* **Shared Port Helpers:** `port_is_free`, `port_is_own`, `port_has_conflict`, `prompt_custom_ports`, `port_url_for`, and `update_wp_site_urls_for_port_change` are now top-level helpers in `main`, shared between `cove install` and `cove ports`.
* **Cleaner `cove add` Output:** `cove add` now writes `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY = false` into `wp-config.php` so WordPress doesn't force `display_errors` back on mid-install, keeping the command output clean. An additional stderr filter strips any remaining `Deprecated:` lines that leak out of wp-cli's colorizer on PHP 8.5.
* **Readme Overhaul:** Major readme refresh, including a new Quick Start section, a "Running Alongside Local, Studio, or DevKinsta" walkthrough, a Troubleshooting section (cert warnings, WSL systemd, port conflicts, DB recovery), and a rewritten Features list that now covers LAN/mobile, Tailscale, Cloudflare share, WordPress migration, and `/etc/hosts` automation.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **"Installation Cancelled" No Longer Reads as "Successful":** The outer `install-cove.sh` installer used to print `SUCCESS: Cove has been installed successfully!` even when the user explicitly cancelled from Cove's interactive prompts. The installer now lets `set -e` handle the non-zero exit from `cove install` cleanly, so a real cancel no longer ends with a contradictory success message.
* **Mailpit Install on Fresh Apple Silicon Macs:** The upstream Mailpit installer hardcodes `/usr/local/bin` as its install directory, which doesn't exist on a fresh Apple Silicon Mac (Homebrew lives at `/opt/homebrew`). Cove now uses `brew install mailpit` on macOS instead, sidestepping the issue entirely. The upstream installer is still used on Linux, where `/usr/local/bin` is always present.
* **FrankenPHP Install on Fresh Apple Silicon Macs:** The official FrankenPHP installer had the same `/usr/local/bin` problem — it would silently drop the binary in the *current working directory* instead of on `PATH`. Cove now runs the installer from a tempdir and, if the binary ends up there, moves it into `$BIN_DIR` (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin`) before continuing.
* **PHP 8.5 Deprecation Noise:** wp-cli 2.12.0's bundled vendor code (`react/promise`, `php-cli-tools/Colors.php`) emits `Deprecated:` warnings on PHP 8.5 that previously flooded every `cove add` run — ~50 lines per install, polluting captured output like the one-time login URL. A combination of PHPRC `display_errors=0`, `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY=false`, and a precision stderr filter on the install subshell now keeps output clean while preserving real errors.
* **IPv6-Only Port Listeners Not Detected:** The initial version of `port_is_free` only probed `127.0.0.1`, which missed IPv6-only listeners like Python's `http.server` (which binds `::` by default). The helper now probes both IPv4 and IPv6 loopback so a service on either stack is seen.
* **`wp --version` Validation Loop:** `install_dependency` used to run `wp --version` as a sanity check after install, which failed when no standalone `php` was on PATH (wp's shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env php`). The check now skips that validation step for `wp`, matching the existing special case for `mariadb`.
* **Adminer Version Detection on macOS:** `cove upgrade` used Perl-regex `grep -oP ... \K` to read the installed Adminer version, which only works on GNU grep. macOS ships BSD grep, so detection silently fell back to "unknown" and the upgrade prompt always asked to re-download even when the current version was up to date. Switched to a portable `LC_ALL=C sed -nE` extraction that pulls the version cleanly from both `VERSION="x.y.z"` and the `@version` docblock.

## [1.7] - 2026-01-31

### ✨ New Features

* **Linux & WSL Support:** Cove now runs natively on Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL. It also includes full support for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
    * Automatic OS and package manager detection (`apt`/`dnf`/`brew`).
    * Smart MariaDB service name detection across different distros.
    * WP-CLI `--allow-root` support for Docker and WSL environments where running as root is common.
* **LAN Access for Mobile Sync:** A new `cove lan` command enables LAN access to your sites for mobile app testing and sync.
    * Assigns a unique port and broadcasts via Bonjour/mDNS for easy device discovery.
    * Includes `cove lan trust` instructions for installing Caddy's CA certificate on mobile devices.
* **Log Viewer:** A new `cove log` command provides quick access to site logs or the global error log.
    * Supports `--follow` (`-f`) flag for real-time log tailing.
* **Public Site Sharing:** A new `cove share` command creates temporary public tunnels using Cloudflare Quick Tunnels.
    * Uses `cloudflared` (installed on-demand via Homebrew if missing).
    * Generates a random public URL that works until you press Ctrl+C.
* **Tailscale Integration:** A new `cove tailscale` command exposes all Cove sites to your Tailscale network.
    * Auto-detects your Tailscale hostname or accepts a manual override.
    * Assigns unique ports to each site, plus fixed ports for Mailpit (9901), Adminer (9902), and the dashboard (9900).
* **Reverse Proxy Management:** A new `cove proxy` command manages standalone reverse proxy entries.
    * Useful for exposing local services (like AI coding tools) via Tailscale or custom domains.
* **Domain Mappings:** A new `cove mappings` command allows a single site to be served from multiple domains.
    * Mappings are automatically added to `/etc/hosts` and the Caddyfile on reload.
* **WSL Hosts Helper:** A new `cove wsl-hosts` command (WSL only) displays PowerShell commands for updating the Windows hosts file so you can access Cove sites from your Windows browser.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Changes

* **Catppuccin Adminer Theme:** A new custom Adminer theme has been bundled with Cove, featuring the beautiful Catppuccin color palette.
    * Automatic light/dark mode switching based on system preferences (Latte for light, Mocha for dark).
    * Full SQL syntax highlighting with Catppuccin colors.
    * Modern UI with improved typography, spacing, and styled action buttons.
* **Adminer Auto-Upgrade:** The `cove upgrade` command now also checks for and installs the latest version of Adminer.
* **Improved Site Listing:** The `cove list` command output has been refined for better readability.
* **Smarter Tailscale Detection:** Tailscale hostname auto-detection has been improved for more reliable setup.
* **Cleaner Error Display:** PHP's `display_errors` is now disabled by default. The Whoops error handler has been refined to silence noisy `E_DEPRECATED` and `E_NOTICE` warnings (common in older plugins) while still displaying fatal errors with full stack traces.
* **Enhanced Share Command:** The `cove share` command now displays a real-time access log showing timestamp, HTTP status (color-coded), client IP address, method, and path for each request. Connection loss is now detected and reported, and shutdown no longer displays terminal noise.

## [1.6] - 2025-09-18

### ✨ New Features

* **Remote Site Pushing:** A new `cove push` command has been introduced to migrate a local Cove site to a remote server via SSH.
    * It features an interactive TUI to guide you through selecting a local site and providing remote credentials.
    * The command creates a local backup, securely uploads it, and then executes a migration script on the remote server to overwrite the destination site's content.

## [1.5] - 2025-09-14

### ✨ New Features

* **Remote Site Pulling:** A new `cove pull` command has been introduced to migrate a remote WordPress site into Cove via SSH.
    * It features an interactive TUI to guide you through providing remote credentials.
    * It can create a new local site or overwrite an existing one.
    * Includes a powerful `--proxy-uploads` flag that skips downloading the `wp-content/uploads` directory and instead configures Caddy to `reverse_proxy` media requests to the live site, saving significant time and disk space.
* **Piped Directives:** The `cove directive add <site>` command now accepts input from `stdin`, allowing you to pipe complex, multi-line Caddy rules directly into a site's configuration. This is ideal for scripting and is used by the new `pull` command to set up the upload proxy.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Changes

* **FrankenPHP Auto-Upgrade:** The `cove upgrade` command is now more powerful. In addition to upgrading the Cove script itself, it now also checks for the latest version of the FrankenPHP binary on GitHub and will automatically download and install it if a newer version is available.
* **Correct Directive Order:** The Caddyfile generation logic has been updated to place custom directives *before* the `php_server` directive. This ensures that custom rules like `reverse_proxy` are evaluated first, which is critical for the new upload proxy feature to function correctly.
* **Automatic Directive Cleanup:** When a site is deleted using `cove delete`, any associated custom Caddy directive file is now also automatically removed, ensuring no orphaned configuration files are left behind.

## [1.4] - 2025-09-11

### ✨ New Features

* **Self-Healing Login Command:** The `cove login` command is now "self-healing." If the command fails, it will automatically check for and inject a required Must-Use (MU) plugin into the WordPress site, then retry the login process. This ensures the command works reliably even on sites created with older versions of Cove or if the plugin was manually deleted.
* **Integrated MU-Plugin:** Cove now uses a dedicated MU-plugin (`captaincore-helper.php`) which is automatically added to new WordPress sites. This plugin provides the core functionality for one-time logins via a custom WP-CLI command (`wp user login <user>`) and also disables WordPress's plugin and theme auto-update email notifications for a cleaner local experience.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Changes

* **Global PHP Memory Limit:** The global PHP `memory_limit` has been increased to **512M** in the main Caddyfile configuration. This helps prevent errors when working with memory-intensive plugins or operations across all sites.
* **Refactored Plugin Injection:** The logic for creating the MU-plugin has been moved into its own dedicated function (`inject_mu_plugin`), cleaning up the `cove add` command and allowing the new self-healing `cove login` command to utilize it.
* **More Robust Dashboard Logins:** The web dashboard's "Login" button is now significantly more reliable. It delegates directly to the `cove login` command, inheriting its new self-healing capabilities and simplifying the dashboard's backend logic.
* **Non-Blocking Server Reloads:** Server reloads triggered from the web UI (or the `cove reload` command) now run as a background process. This fixes a potential deadlock issue, preventing the dashboard from freezing and providing a much smoother user experience when adding, deleting, or modifying sites.

## [1.3] - 2025-08-24

### ✨ New Features

* **Admin Login Command:** A new `cove login <site> [<user>]` command has been added to generate a one-time login link for a WordPress site. This works by finding the first available administrator or by specifying a user ID, email, or login.
* **Dashboard Login Button:** The web dashboard now includes a "Login" button for WordPress sites, allowing for one-click access to the admin area. This is powered by a new `get_login_link` API endpoint.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Changes

* **Automatic `/etc/hosts` Management:** The `reload` command now automatically checks for and adds required entries for all Cove sites to the `/etc/hosts` file, ensuring local domains resolve without manual setup. This requires sudo privileges upon first run.
* **Smarter Installation Script:** The main installer (`install-cove.sh`) is now architecture-aware, correctly using `/opt/homebrew/bin` on Apple Silicon and `/usr/local/bin` on Intel Macs. It will also offer to install Homebrew if it's not detected and attempt to create the installation directory if it doesn't exist.
* **Robust MariaDB Setup:** The `cove install` command now first attempts an automatic, non-interactive `sudo mysql` command to create the database user. If this fails, it falls back to the interactive prompt for root credentials, improving the initial setup experience.
* **Resilient Site Creation:** The `cove add` command for WordPress sites is now more robust. It will automatically clean up the site directory and database if the installation process fails, preventing partial sites. It also now deletes the default "Hello Dolly" and "Akismet" plugins for a cleaner start.

## [1.2] - 2025-08-22

### **New Features**

* **Site Renaming:** A new `cove rename <old-name> <new-name>` command has been added to fully rename a site. This includes updating the directory name, database name, and running a search-and-replace on the site's URL within the database.
* **Path & URL Commands:**
    * Added `cove path <name>` to quickly get the full system path to a site's public directory.
    * Added `cove url <name>` to print the full `https://<name>.localhost` URL for a site.

### **Improvements & Changes**

* **Increased Upload Limits:** The default PHP `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` have been increased to 512M to allow for larger file and database imports.
* **Enhanced `list` Command:** The `cove list` command now includes a "Path" column, displaying the path to each site's public directory.

## [1.1] - 2025-08-02

### **New Features**

* **Interactive Web UI:** A new web-based dashboard has been introduced at `cove.localhost` for managing sites. This interface allows users to:
    * Add and delete sites directly from the browser.
    * View a list of all managed sites with links to each.
    * See the current database user and password configuration.
    * Toggle between light and dark themes.

* **FrankenPHP Support:** The script now detects and prefers a `frankenphp` installation, falling back to `caddy` if it's not found. This allows Cove to leverage the performance benefits of FrankenPHP.

* **One-Time Login URLs:** When creating a new WordPress site, a one-time login URL is now generated and displayed, allowing for quick and easy access to the new site's admin area without needing to manually enter the generated password.

* **Database Listing:** A new command, `cove db list`, has been added. It provides a formatted table of all WordPress sites and their associated database credentials and size.

* **Sizing Information in Site List:** The `cove list` command now includes a `--totals` flag to display the disk usage of each site's `public` directory.

* **Upgrade Command:** A new `cove upgrade` command allows users to automatically fetch and install the latest version of Cove from GitHub.

### **Improvements & Changes**

* **Enhanced `list` Command:** The `cove list` command now outputs a neatly formatted and styled table for better readability, replacing the previous plain text list.

* **Persistent Mailpit Storage:** Mailpit is now launched with a persistent database file (`mailpit.db`), ensuring that emails are not lost when the service is restarted.

* **Adminer Auto-Login:** The Adminer setup now includes an auto-login feature, pre-filling the database credentials from the Cove configuration file for a more seamless experience. A custom theme has also been applied.

* **Improved Output and Styling:** The use of `gum` has been expanded across various commands to provide more consistent and visually appealing feedback, including styled tables, prompts, and messages.

* **Refined Site Creation and Deletion:**
    * The site creation process now validates against a list of protected names (`cove`, `mailpit`, `adminer`).
    * Site names are now restricted to lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
    * The `cove add` command now accepts a `--no-reload` flag to prevent the server from reloading, which is used by the new web UI to manage the process.

* **Better Service Management:**
    * The `cove enable` command now ensures that any running instances of Mailpit are stopped before starting a new one to prevent conflicts.
    * The `cove status` command now provides more readable, color-coded output.

* **Robust Dependency Checks:** The installation script now checks for conflicting services running on ports 80 and 443 and warns the user.

* **Help Command Enhancements:** The help text for all commands has been updated to be more descriptive and now includes subcommand details for `db` and `directive`.

### **Bug Fixes**

* **MariaDB Connection Wait:** The installation script now correctly waits for the MariaDB service to be fully available before attempting to create the database user, preventing a common installation failure.
